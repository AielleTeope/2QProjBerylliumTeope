		<h3> What does the acronym SOGIE stand for?</h3>
		

		<img class="pics" height="400" src="..\images\gingerbread.jpg" alt="genderbread person, the illustration commonly used to explain SOGIE"> </a>
		
		<p> SOGIE is an acronym for Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression. Everyone has an assigned SOGIE, and it isn't exclusive 
		to only the memebers of the LGBTQ+ community. The concept of SOGIE introduces how nuanced a person can be, and how one aspect of their identity
		isn't inherently tied to another. </p>
		
		<p> For example, someone may tend to dress in more feminine clothes like dresses and skirts, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they identify as a woman.</p>
		
		<p> Each aspect of SOGIE is a spectrum, and it may even take others years to figure out where exactly they lie on that spectrum. </p>

		<p>An easy way of explaining SOGIE is the genderbread person, illustrating the differences between the aspects. </p>
